# Abstract
Krystal Distribution Group (KdG): Efficient and Seamless Mineral Logistics
Krystal Distribution Group (KdG) specializes in the efficient and seamless distribution of essential
raw materials, including gypsum, iron ore, cement, petcoke, and slag. They want to renew their
logistics system, as it is outdated and hard to change. They need a new system that can be adapted
easily and makes data available for other systems.
The new logistics system was baptized as KdG MineralFlow, and it aims to optimize the flow of
materials from arrival scheduling to final warehousing.
Currently, KdG handles the following materials, but their state-of-the-art warehouses are capable
of adapting easily to all sorts of raw materials, so the system needs to be capable of handling these
kinds of evolutions.
# Descriptions of Raw Materials
1. Gypsum:
   ○ Description: Gypsum is a soft sulfate mineral composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate.
   It is commonly used in the construction industry for producing plaster, plasterboard,
   and cement. Gypsum is also used in agriculture as a soil conditioner and fertilizer.
   ○ Storage Price per Ton per Day: 1$ / t / d
   ○ Price per Ton: 13$ /ts
2. Iron Ore:
   ○ Description: Iron ore is a naturally occurring mineral from which iron is extracted. It
   is a crucial raw material in the production of steel, which is used extensively in
   construction, manufacturing, and transportation industries. Common types of iron
   ore include hematite and magnetite.

  ○ Storage Price per Ton per Day: 5$ / t / d
  ○ Price per Ton: 110$ / t
3. Cement:
   ○ Description: Cement is a binder substance used in construction that sets, hardens,
   and adheres to other materials to bind them together. It is a key ingredient in
   concrete, mortar, and stucco. Portland cement, made from limestone and clay, is
   the most common type.
   ○ Storage Price per Ton per Day: 3$ / t / d
   ○ Price per Ton: 95$ / t
4. Petcoke (Petroleum Coke):
   ○ Description: Petcoke is a carbon-rich solid material derived from oil refining. It is
   used as a fuel in power generation, cement kilns, and other industrial processes due
   to its high calorific value. Petcoke is also used in the production of electrodes for the
   aluminium and steel industries.
   ○ Storage Price per Ton per Day: 10$ / t / d
   ○ Price per Ton: 210$ / t
5. Slag:
   ○ Description: Slag is a byproduct of the smelting process used to produce metals
   from their ores. It is used in construction as an aggregate in concrete, road
   construction, and as a raw material in cement production. Slag helps improve the
   durability and strength of concrete.
   ○ Storage Price per Ton per Day: 7$ / t / d
   ○ Price per Ton: 160$ / t
